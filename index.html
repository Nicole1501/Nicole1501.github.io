       <h2>Beginnings of the Tennis Player Rafael Nadal</h2>
       <p>
          <b>Rafael Nadal</b> was born in <b>Mallorca, Spain</b>. Since he was a kid he liked to play soccer and tennis, so he practiced both when he was a little kid.<br>
          One day, his uncle <b>Tony Nadal</b>, who was a tennis coach, started to see his talent, so Tony encouraged his little nephew to play tennis and dedicate more to that sport through the years.<br>
          Rafael was fascinated by the sport, followed the instructions of Tony Nadal on the court and outside the court for many years, until he started to win important tournaments.<br>
          At the age of 18, Rafael nadal was known as the youngest player to win the <strong>Roland Garros</strong>, one of the four <i>Grand Slams</i>, and the whole world started to know his name.<br>
          And he was an inspiration for many kids who were starting to play the sport.

       <h2>Rafael Nadal Considered the Best Tennis Player in the World</h2>
       <p>
          After his first <i>Grand Slam</i>, he was unbelievable; he started to win a lot of tournaments year by year, tournaments of different levels like <i>Masters 1000, ATP 500, and Grand Slams.</i><br>
          But beside the titles which shows his succesful carrer, <strong>he was a gentleman and a good person inside and outside the court</strong>; this attitude was also why people considered him as the best player.<br>
          Some of the attitudes that made him a great player were that he respect others players without taking any match for granted, he was humble whether he won or lost, always giving credit to others and to himself in a modest way. <br>
          He was very <b>resilient</b>, in the moments of pain from injuries during matches, or even in matches where he was playing poorly, he did not complain and instead found the mental strength to play and win.

       <h2>His Workethic and Strong Mindset Made Him the Number 1 of the World</h2>
       <p>
          He became the <b>#1 of the world </b> not only because he trained every day or had a special talent, or because of the opportunites in the journey. <br>
          It was because he practiced many hours per day more than others, practices that even <b>Toni Nadal</b> says that were unhealthy for him (in terms of the level of demands)<br>
          Even though he practiced with pain, in poor conditions of the courts and balls, Rafael obeyed to Toni every day, no matter the tiredness.<br>
          <em>He gave his 100% no matter what was going on throughout the day</em>, and Toni said that built his character. People could see this character on the court.<br>
          His mental strength made every match feel like a battle, where he was the warrior who would give his life to win. His hits were not the most skillful, but <em>his mindset was his great weapon.</em><br>

       <h2>How His Tennis Career Inspired Millions of Tennis Players</h2>
       <p>
          His career is built on discipline and sacrifice. People notice and value his success, which inspires admiration and a desire to one day be like him.<br>
          Every Rafael's match <u>pays</u> is a lesson in mental strength, in how overcome difficulties, and many people watch him to learn these techniques.<br>
          The way he respects and values his opponents, and accepts victories and defeats with humility, is something very few in the sport do.<br>
          It shows how great he is, not only in terms of achievements but also as a person, and <mark>people see him as a role model.</mark><br>
          Even for me, who is writing this and has been a huge fan of him since I started playing tennis when I was a little, he is an inspiration.<br>
          <mark>He is a tennis legend, but above all, he is a life legend</mark>. The way he has managed his successful career while upholding his values has made him a great example of true success.
